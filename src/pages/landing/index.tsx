        <p>Do you have a pile of games you haven't played yet? Are you struggling to keep track of which games you own,

          ones you've completed, and which ones you're currently playing? Backlog App is here to help!</p>

      <section>
        <p>With Backlog App, you can easily create a personalized backlog of all the games you own or want to play,
          and
          keep track of your progress for each one. You can add games to your backlog manually, or import them from
          popular
          gaming platforms like Steam, Xbox, PlayStation, and more.</p>

        <p>Once you've added your games, you can organize them by platform, genre, release date, or any other criteria
          you
          like. You can also set goals and deadlines for completing your backlog, and receive reminders when you're
          falling
          behind.</p>

      <section>
        <p>But that's not all - Backlog App also provides detailed information and statistics about your gaming
          habits,
          so you can see which genres you prefer, how many hours you've spent on each game, and more. You can even
          connect
          with other gamers and compare your backlogs and achievements.</p>
