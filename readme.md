# Backlog App Client

[![E2E tests](https://github.com/NeiruBugz/backlog-app/actions/workflows/playwright.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NeiruBugz/backlog-app/actions/workflows/playwright.yml)

I'm in love with games. Buying and not playing them, mostly.
To fix my gaming behavior I need a gaming backlog tracker.
So, this is my attempt to organize my gaming backlog as a pet-project

## What I'm trying to achieve

1. Organize my gaming backlog
2. Improve my skills as a frontend engineer
3. Improve my self-management skills, cause I'm the only one interested in this project for this time
4. Use something new for a tech stack

## What this app uses

* React
* TypeScript
* RTK
* Scss modules
* Antd Components
* FSD-architecture
* [howlongtobeat package](https://github.com/ckatzorke/howlongtobeat)
* Playwright for e2e-tests
* Vitest for unit-tests
* react-i18next
